Quick TODO list from what I can see:

Get first triangle on all supported GENs

4 - 965g/965gm - works
4.5 - gm45
5 - ilk - works
6 - snb
7 - ivy - draws pink but crashes
7.5 - hsw - draws pink but crashes

Work out state dirty handling
- some sort of per GEN dirty handling?

Work out batchbuffer growing/state cycling
