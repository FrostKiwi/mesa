    *
    *  1) When a block pool is resized, we create a new gem handle with a

    *     different center offset but we re-use the same anv_bo struct when
    *     we do so.  If this happens in the middle of setting up an execbuf,
    *     we could end up with our list of BOs out of sync with our list of
    *     gem handles.
    *
    *  2) The algorithm we use for building the list of unique buffers isn't
    *     thread-safe.  While the client is supposed to syncronize around
    *     QueueSubmit, this would be extremely difficult to debug if it ever
    *     came up in the wild due to a broken app.  It's better to play it
    *     safe and just lock around QueueSubmit.
    *
    *  3)  The anv_cmd_buffer_execbuf function may perform relocations in
    *      userspace.  Due to the fact that the surface state buffer is shared
    *      between batches, we can't afford to have that happen from multiple
    *      threads at the same time.  Even though the user is supposed to
    *      ensure this doesn't happen, we play it safe as in (2) above.
    *
    * Since the only other things that ever take the device lock such as block
    * pool resize only rarely happen, this will almost never be contended so
    * taking a lock isn't really an expensive operation in this case.
